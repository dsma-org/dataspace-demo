    <h2>III. Data Processing – General Information</h2>

    <h3>1. Scope of the Processing of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>RWTH Aachen University processes personal data of visitors of the site only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The collection and processing of the personal data of our users take place only with the user's consent. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p>

    <h3>2. Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Insofar as RWTH Aachen University obtains the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as a legal basis.</p>

    <p>In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as a legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual activities.</p>

    <p>As far as the processing of personal data is required for the fulfillment of responsibilities which are carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e GDPR serves as a legal basis for this processing.</p>

    <h3>3. Deletion of Data and Duration of Storage</h3>
    <p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to exist. Furthermore, data may be stored if this is required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws, or other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned regulations expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.</p>




    <h2>IV. Provision of the Website and Generation of Log Files</h2>
    <h3>1. Description and Scope of Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Each time our website is accessed, the RWTH Aachen University system may collect automated data and information from the computer system of the user's computer.</p>

    <p>In this process, the following data may be collected:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Information on the browser and version used</li>
        <li>Information on the operating system of the user</li>
        <li>The internet service provider of the user</li>
        <li>The IP address of the user</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Websites from which the user's system is led to the RWTH Aachen University website</li>
        <li>Information on websites visited and files opened</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The data is stored in the log files of the University's system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p>

    <h3>2. Legal basis for data processing</h3>
    <p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

    <h3>3. Purpose of data processing</h3>
    <p>Temporary storage of the IP address through the system is necessary to deliver the website to the user’s computer. To this end, the user’s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>

    <p>The data is used for the purpose of optimizing the website and ensuring the safety of information technology systems. The data is not evaluated for marketing purposes in this context.</p>

    <h3>4. Duration of storage</h3>
    <p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for carrying out the purpose of its collection. Typically, data is deleted seven days after its storage at the latest. It is possible that the data is stored for a longer period. In this case, the user's IP address is deleted or anonymized, so that the client accessing the website can no longer be identified.</p>

    <h3>5. Possibility of Objection and Remedy</h3>
    <p>The collection of data for the purpose of providing the website and the storage of data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.</p>
